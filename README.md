# CrewAI Series

In this repository, I will be documenting my learning journey from basic to advanced concepts. The following files are currently included:

- `basic_setup.ipynb`: This notebook covers the initial setup and configuration required to start working with the CrewAI.
- `custom_tool.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates how to create and use custom tools with CrewAi workflow.

More files will be added in the future as I continue to expand my knowledge and skills.

Stay tuned for updates!
